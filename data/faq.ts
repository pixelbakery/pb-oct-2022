    questionName: 'What’s the difference between you guys, the people on Upwork, and my nephew?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'We provide our clients with high-end, custom tailored solutions that perfectly align with their brand standards, their story, and their expectations. If animation was a bar, the bartender would be on his tippy toes when he pulls us off the shelf.',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'How do you measure ROI on a video?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      "Our approach to creative is goal-oriented. Our clients come to us with a specific problem, objective, or pain point. Outside of direct sales metrics, it's a bit harder to measure ROI on videos. Our work is a part building the sum. This means that ROI is measured by brand integrety and engagement rather than dollars and checkouts.",
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Are internships paid?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'Absolutely. We are fundamentally against the concept of unpaid internships/internships. Our apprentices are providing value to our company and thus deserve to be compensated at a competetive rate. ',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'My budget is $500, can I afford you?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'Not likely, but feel free to make your case. We love unique projects. Otherwise, try upwork.com or your nephew',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Where’d you get the name Pixel Bakery?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'It was actually an autocorrect typo. When we were tossing around potential names for our studio, one of us started typing Pixel B, and the rest was history. For the sake of the story, I wish we could remember what the rest of the B was originally intended to be.',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Do you do job shadows?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      "Yes, but we're quite particular. Check out more info on our <a hrefLang={'en-US'} class='text-peach underline' href='careers/job-shadow'>job shadows</a> page.",
  },
  {
    questionName: 'How long does it take to make an animation?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      "That's a pretty hard one to answer without having a discovery meeting and knowing the scope. It all depends on complexity. We like to have enough breathing room to ensure the level of quality our clients expect from us, so typically we don't do rush jobs. Sometimes we will if we have room in our production pipeline, but there's a surcharge. A good baseline: a 90 second 2D animation, on average, usually takes us about two months. That's with us developing the story, scripting, storyboarding, concepting, and animating. ",
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Do you do spec work?',
    acceptedAnswerText: `Sure don't, and neither should you. See below:

  },
  {
    questionName: 'Are you competitors with ad agencies?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      "Nope. In fact, our client roster consists of roughly 40% ad agencies and other production studios. There's plenty of creative to go around, and we want to help others succeed. When agencies/studios hire us, we take on their heavy-load projects or specialized tasks that can’t be taken on internally.",
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Why should I hire you instead of use an internal team?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      "We'd never say that! Our best clients have internal teams that we work in lock step with. However, sometimes it's hard to see the forest through the trees. An external studio like us can provide a valuable outside perspective. ",
  },
  {
    questionName: 'How do I know if a girl is into me?',
    acceptedAnswerText: 'We don’t know =[ If you figure it out, can you let us know?',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Where do we go when we die?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'Great questions! No one really knows. Some would say the absence of an answer is what makes life worth living. If we knew where we go when we die, what would be the point of doing anything worthwhile while we’re not dead?',
  },
  {
    questionName: 'Do you shoot weddings?',
    acceptedAnswerText:
      'Eventually the cold grip of entropy will consume the universe, and leave it a cold and lonely husk void of any life. Every star will fade and darkness will become the only constant. Please see <a hrefLang="en-US" class="text-peach underline" href="https://wearefostercreative.com/" target="_blank">wearefostercreative.com</a> for anything wedding related. Mazel tov!!',
