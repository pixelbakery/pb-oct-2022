  },
  {
    questionName: `Who will own the rights to the final video?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `It's your IP and always will be. With that said, there are some limitations. The 'working files' are owned by Pixel Bakery and generally not released to you.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `How do you ensure the quality and consistency of videos for recurring clients?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `We maintain detailed records of all projects, including style guides, client preferences, and feedback. For recurring clients, we often have dedicated teams to ensure consistency and familiarity with the brand's voice and style.`,

  },
  {
    questionName: `Are there any hidden fees in your pricing?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `We pride ourselves on transparency. All potential costs will be detailed in our proposal, with no hidden fees or surprises. There are some things that aren't included in the base project cost, such as paying for voiceovers, music, SFX, transcription services, etc, but we will always get prior approval from you before making a purchase.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Do you create animated whiteboard videos?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Nope, we do not. Sorry. We pride ourselves in being a custom-tailored high quality studio. Whiteboard videos are generic and lack any brand personality. We suggest you avoid them.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `What is the difference between animation and motion graphics?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Great question. Overall, they're pretty interchangable. Animation is a broad term that includes creating moving images using various techniques, including traditional hand-drawn methods or computer-generated imagery (CGI). Motion graphics specifically refer to graphic design in motion, often used for informational content like explainer videos, title sequences, or animated logos.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `What types of animation do you offer?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `We pride ourselves on being what we call 'Design Agnostic.' If you take a look at our portfolio page, you'll notice that not two projects look alike. We adapt our style/technique to the individual needs of our clients and their brand identities. From a broader perspective, we offer 2D animation, 3D animation, stop motion, character animation, and much more.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `How long does it take to complete an animation project?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `It really depends. Things like complexity, style, duration, and much more all impact the length of an animation project. As a general rule of thumb, a 90-second 2D animation with minimal character animation takes about 6 to 8 works from scripting to completion.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can I be involved in the animation process?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `As much or as little as you want! Every client is different and we adapt to our client's needs. Another production studio might hire us just to execute on the animation portion of a project, and a CPG client may want help with scripting and creative concepting. It's all the same to us ðŸ˜Ž`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `What do you need from me to start the project?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `A clear brief, any brand guidelines or assets, your preferred animation style, and the message or story you want to convey are essential. Any existing scripts or voiceovers can also be beneficial.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can you help with scriptwriting, creative concepting, and voiceovers?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yes, we have scriptwriters and a network of professional voiceover artists in various languages and tones to cater to your project needs.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `How do you price your animation services?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Pricing is based on the style of animation, complexity, duration, and additional services like scriptwriting or voiceovers. We provide custom quotes for each project to ensure you get the best value.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can I make revisions once the animation is done?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yes, we include a set number of revision rounds. However, extensive changes or revisions after these rounds may incur additional charges. We'll always have a conversation about extra cost with you before we send you a bill.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Do you offer character design services?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Absolutely. Our team of artists can design unique and engaging characters tailored to your brand or story.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can my animated video be optimized for social media?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yup! We can create animations in formats optimized for various social media platforms, ensuring the best playback and engagement. We call them 'modulations.' There are over 60 different aspect ratios and time optimizations for you to choose from.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Do you provide storyboarding services?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yes, storyboarding is a crucial part of our pre-production process, ensuring a clear visual guide before the actual animation begins.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `What are the benefits of using animation over live-action video?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Both have their time and their place. Animation offers flexibility and can bring abstract concepts to life, which might be challenging in live-action. It's also cost-effective as there's no need for locations, actors, or physical props.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Do you keep backups of the projects?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yes. We're extreme data hoarders. We keep archives of all of our working files, and can re-render a video if you lose it. We can also go back and make any changes you need.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can you match the animation style of an existing video or reference?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Yes, if you have a particular style in mind, share it with us, and we'll do our best to match or adapt it to your needs.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `Can animations be integrated with other media or live-action video?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `Absolutely- we refer to them as 'hybrid' videos. We can create animations that can be seamlessly integrated with live-action footage or other media forms.`,
  },
  {
    questionName: `What file formats will the final animation be delivered in?`,
    acceptedAnswerText: `We deliver all of our videos via Vimeo. Vimeo provides an auto-compression service for you to download several different formats. All of our Masters are 4k UHD (3840x2160) .MOV files with an Apple ProRes 4444 codec.`,
