Olli Jenkins is a third year student at the Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts at UNL. They are devoted to design in all forms but specialize in experience design, adapting found objects, and curating their reality through sensory stimulation. She loves to unwind by painting or reading with a cup of hibiscus tea as much as she loves Mortal Kombat. Olli believes that fashion + personal style are close to godliness, sustainability is everything, and that we all really need each other.
