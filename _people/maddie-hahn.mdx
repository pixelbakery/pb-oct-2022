Maddie joined the Pixel Bakery team as studio manager, which basically means she does a little bit of everything to make sure that the studio runs as smoothly as a freshly baked butter-soft bun. She graduated with a double major in journalism and advertising from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during a global pandemic, not ideal but it led her here! People are always saying that they'd never go back to their first 'real-world' job, but I never want to leave mine.
