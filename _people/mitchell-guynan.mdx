Mitchell is a recent graduate from UNLâ€™s Emerging Media Arts program with emphases in cinematic arts and virtual production. He loves kicking back and playing video games with his buds, or should the weather allow it, a skate session around the neighborhood waving at all the dogs he passes. Mitchell gets a huge kick out of showing people his comic book collection, talking shop about the newest camera that just released, or cracking a dad joke when everyone least expects it.
