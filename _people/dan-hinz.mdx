I'm a graphic designer from Lincoln, Nebraska, and a recent UNL grad. I am really into illustrative design, and am passionate about utilizing animation for visual storytelling. I hyperfocus on the small details in my work. Frame by frame, I strive to perfect and execute my ideas, so I can learn as much as possible in the process.
