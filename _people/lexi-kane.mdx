Lexi comes to Pixel Bakery all the way from Wisconsin! Lexi graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in 2021 with a double major in Graphic Communications and Spanish as well as a certificate in Integrated Strategic Communication. Basically, sheâ€™s REALLY good at communicating. During their time in Wisconsin, Lexi founded a local maker market to support local artists and makers who were unable to sell their work during the pandemic. They were also involved in coordinating fashion event in their community. Community is incredibly important to Lexi and she is excited to bring her passion for community building to the PB team.
