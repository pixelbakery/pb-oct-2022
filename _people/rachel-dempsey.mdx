Rachel is in her last semester at the UNL studying Graphic Design and Advertising. She loves anything and everything when it comes to art & design. When not in class or working, Rachel loves to head out for a run or stay inside with a good book. If you ever get a chance, ask her about having Celiac Disease & sheâ€™ll show you her tattoo of the certified GF logo (this is not a joke). Despite being allergic to gluten, Rachel loves to cook, bake and eat lots of delicious tasting food.
