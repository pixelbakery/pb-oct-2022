As a capricorn, Lesley is really excited to make sure the studio doesn’t go down in flames and runs as smoothly as possible. During her free time she likes to freak herself out by listening to Led Zeppelin and Greta Van Fleet back to back. She also likes cooking, trying out new cafes, and hunting down vinyls. Her current mission is to find both Frank Ocean’s Endless and Lamp’s Genso. She misspells her own name a lot and her favorite Disney princess is Remy from Ratatouille.
