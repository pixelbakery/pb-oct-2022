Kaitlyn, or KP for short, joined Pixel Bakery so she could be part of a work environment filled with creativity and expression. As our Account Executive, she looks forward to expanding her network and exploring new concepts. She will be graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May and can’t wait to escape the world of late nights filled with homework and studying. With her new-found freedom, she hopes to discover new hobbies, books, and music — recommendations are welcome!
