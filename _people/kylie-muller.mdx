Kylie is in her senior year at UNL studying emerging media arts, and she loves everything about video production and creative technology. She’s the captain of the Cornhusker Marching Band Flagline, and when not at Pixel Bakery or in class, she’ll likely be found in Memorial Stadium. She is obsessed with pasta, flying her drone, Taylor Swift and old cameras. Her biggest passion is telling stories through video to create change in the world.
