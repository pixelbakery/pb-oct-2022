Elaina never understood why people would write that they hate writing bios as their bio description, until she was asked to write this one. Elaina joined Pixel Bakery because Jordan said she could have the desk by the dog. She graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design which somehow resulted with a career as an account executive. Her life goals are to eventually run a rabbit sanctuary, write a children’s book, and marry Hugh Jackman. She wants to be buried with giant bags of coffee because she’ll probably be perpetually tired in the next life too.
