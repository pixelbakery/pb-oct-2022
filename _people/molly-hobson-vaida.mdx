Molly has worked in the arts and culture sector since she graduated from the University of Nebraska Omaha. Having worked every position from curator to janitor, she developed a love for supporting creative projects.. Along with her work as the “Scheduling General” at Pixel Bakery, she runs a curation service called Landlock Gallery that works with Nebraska artists to coordinate and promote local art shows and programs.

She enjoys snuggling with her Australian shepherd Charlie, sending anime memes to her husband and reading books about old houses. 

She has to eat gluten free and hates everything about that.
