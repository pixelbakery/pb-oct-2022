Tyler joined Pixel Bakery because he wanted to learn more about the culinary expertise behind baking. Boy, was he in for a sweet surprise. As our a multimedia designer, he specializes in loud groaning and chugging copious amounts of coffee. Tyler is currently a senior advertising and graphic design student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and hopes to one day live his inner baker truth.
