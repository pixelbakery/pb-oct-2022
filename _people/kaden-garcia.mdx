Kaden is in his senior year at UNL, cooking up a degree in emerging media arts. He loves fashion, music, and is a connoisseur of pop culture. With a ton of experience with coffee and an obsession with watching bad reality TV, he brings a unique spice to the mix. In school, his "emerging media art" involves projections, audio design, interactivity, and an overall focus on making things look nice. 

In his free time, you can find him hanging out with his cats or taking long naps. 

Kaden is excited to be incredibly unserious, promising to contribute some mediocre puns and good vibes to the mix!
