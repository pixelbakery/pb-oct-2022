Karley founded Pixel Bakery because she was a nerd in high school and wants to show the world that sheâ€™s cool now. Karley is a plant enthusiast, avid cyclist, concert junkie, and a bonafide vegan in the midwest. She has degrees in both advertising and graphic design from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. While she is a stellar designer and creative director, her downfalls include her deep appreciation of bands like The Smiths and Radiohead, and spending 40% of her income on concert tickets.
