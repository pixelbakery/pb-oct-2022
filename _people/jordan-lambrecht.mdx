Jordan founded Pixel Bakery because he couldn't find a job. His alma mater is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where he received a Bachelor of Arts. Artistically trained, he brings a different perspective to advertising and how design works and the creative process can be approached. He's been asked roughly 314 times if PB is a real bakery, which generally results in disappointment when he informs them that the last thing he cooked was burnt popcorn over a month ago.
