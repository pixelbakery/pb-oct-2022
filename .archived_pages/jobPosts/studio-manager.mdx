Much like the band manager in School of Rock, you’re in charge of everything. You’ll be got a constantly running, organized checklist and you love to check off tasks. You’ll maintain the behind-the-scenes of PB by organizing, scheduling, communicating, restocking and planning our internal and client-facing activities. Everyday is different in this role, with a new set of tasks and challenges. But you’re adaptable and love to chase down a side quest. 




## Roles & Responsibilities

Your responsibilities will fall into four main categories:

**Studio Management**

Our studio is your kingdom. Decorate it, paint it, rearrange it—the vibe is in your hands.

 - Keep the studio running smoothly by ordering supplies, replenishing snacks, maintaining schedules, organizing meetings, communicating with visitors, answering the phone, and checking the mailbox.
- Keep studio clean and organized daily.

## Perks
- **Pay:** $15/hr. / 20ish hours a week
- **Office snacks:** Need I say more?
- **Flex-ish schedule:** As long as the majority of your hours take place between 9–5 on Mon–Fri, you should be all set.
- **Hybrid-ish work environment:** The majority of your week will be spent in office, but if there are some days where that’s just not going to happen, that’s chill.
  Overall, we treat you like a human. But, a human we want to be able to talk to and collaborate with on a consistent basis.
- **Equipment & Gear:** We believe in giving our team the space to be creative outside of work. You have access to our studio, computers, camera gear, and equipment whenever and for whatever you’d like.
- **Gym Membership:** PB covers half of your gym membership each month. Gotta keep that body as healthy as that brain, ya know? Gym is subjective and can also be anything from yoga classes to your Peloton membership.
- **Book Club:** We’ll buy you a book of your choice each month.
