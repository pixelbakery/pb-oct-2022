<CaseStudiesIntro title={''}>

Our very first project with the Los Angeles based media giant. We provided two short but engaging animations for two episodes of their popular series. Using archival photos, we pieced together engaging imagery that served as a companion to what the host was explaining. In the process, we learned a bit more about the Declaration of Independence and Jim Crow Laws, and how both are still relevant in the US today.
