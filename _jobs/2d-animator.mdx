Pixel Bakery is looking for a talented 2D animator to join our team. You love to make your drawings come to life as animations. You can keep track of multiple projects at once, are communicative, collaborative, and excited by creating. Storytelling comes naturally to you. At Pixel Bakery, we’re on the cutting edge of video editing and motion design, so we expect and would appreciate someone who is highly experimental and always willing to learn new things.

## Roles + Responsibilities

- This can be a full-time position, up to 40 hours per week OR a part-time position, up to 25 hours per week.
- Work closely with our creative director and project manager to develop, storyboard, and execute animated projects.
- Deep knowledge and interest in character rigging.
- Use graphic design and illustration sensibilities when composing scenes.
- Ability to enhance storytelling with animation.
- Familiarity with hand-off between design and animation.
- Ability to work and create independently, but also interpret, execute and improve upon other team members’ concepts and ideas.
- Continue to learn new tools and techniques that can be applied to your animations, composition, and storytelling abilities.
- Must be available to work in-office as needed.

## Requirements

- Proven work experience as an animator.
- Solid experience with digital technology and editing software packages (We use DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, After Effects, Cinema 4D).
- Experience working in Illustrator and Photoshop.
- Demonstrable animation and illustration ability with a strong portfolio.
- Thorough knowledge of timing, motivation, and continuity.
- Creative mind and storytelling skills.
- Must be adept at problem-solving and thinking quickly on your feet.
- Openness to direction, mentoring, and training to improve skills.

A hint from our creative director: Don’t self-reject. You may have just what we need with a little more coaching and collaborating with our team of young but experienced folks. If you’re a self-starter with tons of potential, you’re on the right track.
