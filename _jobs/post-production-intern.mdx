Pixel Bakery is looking for a talented video nerd _cough_ excuse us, post-production enthusiast to join our team. You are obsessed with all the technical ins and outs of production, color-grading, editing, as well as crafting a cohesive, creative story as a video editor. You are a whiz at color correction, [creative concepting](/services/creative-strategy), and keeping track of multiple projects at once. Movies are permanently ruined for you because you pay more attention to the shot compositions than the plot. At Pixel Bakery, we're on the cutting edge of video editing and motion design, so we expect and would appreciate someone who is highly experimental and always willing to learn new things.

## roles + responsibilities

- Work closely with our creative director and project manager to develop, create and produce videos.
- Designs, transports, sets up, and operates production equipment, including camera, audio, and lighting equipment for location or studio productions. May include live events.
- Edit video segments, including color grading and audio editing, to be used in a variety of formats for digital or broadcast production.
- Use post-production editing to tell concise, visually pleasing stories.
- Enhance branding in videos by creating short graphics which can consist of animated logo entrances, lower thirds, and other animations as needed.
- Availability to travel on weekends for production as needed (likely once or twice a quarter).
- This is a part-time internship position, up to 20 hours per week.
- Must be available to work in-office and on set as needed.

## requirements

- Proven work experience as a video editor
- Solid experience with digital technology and editing software packages (We use DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, After Effects, and Audition)
- Demonstrable video editing ability with a strong portfolio
- Thorough knowledge of timing, motivation, and continuity
- Proficiency in keying, rotoscoping, and motion tracking
- Creative mind and storytelling skills
– A junior or senior in college
– A Nebraskan (Sorry, no WFH for this one)

A hint from our creative director: Don't self-reject. You may have _just_ what we need with a little more coaching and collaborating with our team of young but experienced folks. If you're a self-starter with tons of potential, you're on the right track.

## Qualities We Look For

- Receptive to feedback. Can handle critique and has an understanding that critique should never be taken personally.
- Reliable self-starter who is equally productive when working independently or on a team.
- Excellent communication and grammar skills, as well as a love for puns.
- Strong understanding of writing for advertising.
- A positive personality.
- Passionate about the design industry and storytelling as a means of communication.
- Goal-oriented, with a drive to hit deadlines.
- The ability to self-teach and problem-solve.
- Must be trustworthy and transparent.

## Perks

- **Office snacks:** Need I say more?
- **Class Credit:** 99% of the time, UNL will let you earn class credit towards your degree for working with us
- **competitive Pay:** Our internships are ALWAYS paid, and at a competitive rate to boot. You create value for our company and you deserve to be compensated for that.
- **Flex-ish schedule:** As long as the majority of your hours take place between 9–5 on Mon–Fri, you should be all set.
- **Hybrid-ish work environment:** The majority of your week will be spent in office, but if there are some days where that’s just not going to happen, that’s chill.
  Overall, we treat you like a human. But, a human we want to be able to talk to and collaborate with on a consistent basis.
- **Equipment & Gear:** We believe in giving our team the space to be creative outside of work. You have access to our studio, computers, camera gear, and equipment whenever and for whatever you’d like.
