              When we work with other production companies or agencies, we come on and act as an
              extension of your team. We come in and pave over potholes that you otherwise couldn't
              fill yourselvesâ€“ wether that's due to bandwidth, time, skillset, or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              We know it's a fine line between collaboration and competition when working with other
              production companies, so we take boundaries and chain of command very seriously. We
              will only communicate with you and never reach out to your client, and will respect
              the heirarchy that you establish.
            </p>
