Before becoming an ACD at PB, I played graphic designer at a wide range of companies:

🎒 in-house at a university

🎨 on a tiny team at a design shop

👔 on a big team at a marketing agency

This variety has helped me really understand how a #productionstudio, like PB, fits in the picture.

❌ We're not here to tell you how to do things.

❌ We don't know your business better than you do; it's just the honest truth.

✅ What we do bring to the table is the top-shelf execution, time and time again. We understand #design, #video, and how to expand your #brand ecosystem with those tools. Simple as that.

What's refreshing about working at Pixel Bakery, as opposed to your typical agency, is that we specialize in doing a few things really, really well.

❌ We're not looking to jump on the next big money-making service to increase our margins.

❌ We're not going to tell you we can do something that we can't.

✅ We're only looking to make really cool, designed experiences—be it videos, websites, or branded content—with companies that care about bringing those experiences to their audience.

It's been so rewarding to work with clients that don't feel like they're being bamboozled and who see us as a real partner in their success. Because that's exactly what we are, a very nice, very specific tool used to bring success to your business.
