Pixel Bakery recently created a logo for Omaha Spring Cleanup, an annual initiative by Keep Omaha Beautiful that focuses on community beautification and environmental education.

Keep Omaha Beautiful came to us with a problem. They wanted a logo for their event that would stand the test of time. Instead of creating a new logo every year, they wanted something that was fresh and fun, but polished enough to remain timeless.

When designing a logo it is important to practice repetition to get the best final design. From conception to completion the logo was reworked over and over again until we finally landed on something that we were proud of and the client loved. We played with elements of design such as spacing and scale to make sure each cloud was perfectly dispersed and each building came together to form the Omaha skyline.

Repetition and reiteration are basic design principles taught in beginning design classes, but they are still so essential to what to makes designers great at their craft. After many revisions, we were able to provide Keep Omaha Beautiful with a progressive mark that was warm and inviting to the community.

Doing branding for something as large scale as a city can get a little tricky. Let's say you're making a mark for a local coffee shop. Chances are, you know exactly who your target demographic is. You'll know the average age of your customers, what kind of experience they want when they come in, and how you want them to perceive your company. Not an extremely simple thing, but it's not necessarily hard either. When you're designing something that will be used by an entire city, the target demographic widens immensely. Your age is suddenly "any" and your type of buyer becomes "all." We struggled a little bit in the beginning shifting between being too urban versus too "wilderness." Jordan really loved the idea of putting pine trees in the mark with birds soaring over them, but that's not really something you see in a city. In the end we came to a happy medium between the two, showing a brilliant sky and the skyline of Omaha.

We hope our design will aid in engaging Omaha residents with this event and will make this year's Omaha Spring Cleanup the most successful yet.
