We love a lot of things about WordPress. It has so many time-saving features that it makes a lot of the heavy lifting of web development much lighter. Still, it does have its foibles and isn’t a universal, one-size-fits-all solution. Having created many sites using WordPress as a content management system, we’ve learned that there are some good reasons to use WordPress to create your website, and some good reasons you might want to use another solution.

# Cost: Free

**Good:** You don’t have to spend thousands of dollars on some proprietary solution that nobody has ever heard of. If you’re really on a shoestring, you can even have your site hosted for free on wordpress.com. (For another $100/year, you can have more customization options and not have ads served on your site.)

**Bad:** You can’t argue with Free!
