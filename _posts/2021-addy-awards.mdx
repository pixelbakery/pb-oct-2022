This past year has certainly taken its toll on the creative field. There's only so much fun you can have doing your job from the comfort of your own bed in your PJs -- it got old realllll fast, and then the challenge kicked in. Creativity isn't a solo sport. It's a collaborative act, and with a global pandemic at the forefront of everyone's concern, advertising companies all around the world had to get creative on how to get creative.

We are insurmountably proud of the work we produced this past year. We made some cool stuff for some cool people, and we can confidently say that we've produced our best content to-date, despite all the obstacles.

Pixel Bakery brought home some cred at this year'sÂ [ADDYÂ®Â Awards](https://getthegreenlight.co/). Our multimedia designer,Â [Tyler Loebig](https://www.tylerloebig.com/), and our Associate Creative Director,Â [Madeline Christensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeline-christensen/), wonÂ [AAF Lincoln's](https://aaflincoln.org/about/)Â "Ad Rookies of the Year" award. They produced the branding & web design for the ADDY's this year, and we couldn't be more happy for them. They're the true definition of "creatives" and we are so incredibly proud to call them members of the PB team.

Pixel Bakery also won a Gold ADDYÂ®Â for our website creation for [Holly's Healthy Holes](https://hollyshealthyholes.com/). If you're looking for some guilt-free donuts, hop on over to Holly's site and take a peek around.

We think you'll like what you see! ðŸ˜‰

As a small agency, we are so thrilled to be able to hold our own amongst the larger agencies around town that we know & love. You inspire us each day -- thank you.

Love,
PB
