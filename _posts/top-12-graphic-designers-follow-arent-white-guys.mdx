I’ve been thinking a lot lately about diversity in design. I graduated in 2021 with a degree in Graphic Communication (which is a Graphic Design degree without the BFA). My classes were full of women, but we never learned about female designers. I think we did learn a bit about Paula Scher, but only because a student in class did a project on her. My campus was voted one of the most LGBTQ-friendly campuses, but we never learned about LGBTQ designers.

The standard of work that was presented to us was from a white, male, European lens. Granted, my history of graphic design professor stopped teaching class during the pandemic so I really didn’t get a chance to learn anything about the topic, but still. I’ve realized my disappointment in the lack of diversity in design spaces, as well as the lack of representation that I experienced.

I recognize that not everyone has had the same experience as me, and that’s also totally ok. I’m sure other folks have had an incredible experience in their design journey. I also recognize my privilege in being able to attend school for design, but I also see the ways in which my education and experience had it’s issues. Because of the lack of education I had in school regarding this topic, I’ve taken it upon myself to relearn what it means to be a designer, and I want to shout out the following literature:

- [Extra Bold by Jennifer Tobias and Ellen Lupton](https://papress.com/products/extra-bold)
- [Queer x Design by Andy Campell](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/andy-campbell/queer-x-design/9780762467853/)

These books have challenged the way I think about design and have been the first times I’ve seen myself and my friends represented in an academic way. This isn’t sponsored in any way! Just genuinely loved the material and highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about the history of design from a new perspective.

In my opinion, the current standard of design is male, cis, and white. So, I’ve compiled a list of my current favorites that challenge that. My own top 10, if you will. Plus a few. These are my favorite non-white-male designers, and I hope you think they’re just as cool as I do. All information has been taken from the artist’s websites + social media accounts.

## **2. Julia Fletcher**

“Julia Fletcher (she/her) is a music-based graphic designer and photographer based in Brooklyn, NY with over a decade of digital art experience. She has her BFA in Photography + Art History from the Maryland Institute College of Art, and taught herself everything she knows about graphic design by experimenting with Photoshop after hours of previous jobs.

Inspired by clashing colors, repetition in patterns and shapes, and maximalist compositions, she brings a colorful and nostalgic feeling to musician’s identities through a contemporary lens. Her process involves collecting found imagery, patterns, and textiles from the late 70’s and early 80’s to re-contextualize and collage archival material to give it new life. She finds inspiration in new wave bargain bin album artwork, art deco, Memphis architecture, Italian horror movies, and vintage Rafaella sweaters.

She currently works as an in-house designer for Secretly Group (Dead Oceans, Jagjaguwar, Secretly Canadian, Saddest Factory) and freelances for various clients such as Bravado (UMG), Live Nation, Red Star Merchandise, Grand Jury, Fire Talk Records, and more. Previously, she was designing at VMP (Vinyl Me, Please) and Second City Prints.

When she has free time, she's road tripping to hear live music, learning how to play bass, record shopping, or at a movie theater.”

## **10. Elyssa Abi Karam**

“Elyssa graduated from AUB's business school in 2016; however, the degree didn't quite resonate as the right fit for her. Design, on the other hand, captured her heart, and the art of merging functionality with aesthetics swiftly evolved into an obsession. Progressing from an intensive design course to hands-on learning and self-exploration, Elyssa proudly claims the title of a self-taught designer.

Vibrant color palettes, the beauty of nature, and the allure of the beach serve as constant sources of inspiration that fuel Elyssa's creativity. Her design philosophy often draws from these wellsprings of creativity, imbuing her work with a unique and distinguishing style. Authenticity, innovation, and a sense of elevation define her approach. Elyssa loves to experiment with illustration and graphics, occasionally indulging her creative spirit with a film camera. When she's not found behind her laptop, you might discover her lost in contemplation by the beach (pun intended), creating culinary delights, or thoroughly enjoying a Netflix binge.”

“Oriel used to be a chef. But he got sick of the long hours, intense pressure, and being shouted at by men with knives. So he got into advertising. Now, Oriel is a Creative Director at Spotify in New York. He's won some awards, which is nice. He's worked with some talented people, which is nicer. And there's less knives. Which is great.”
