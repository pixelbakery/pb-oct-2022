We now have as many ADDY's as Leo DiCaprio has Oscars. Congrats to all the 2017 ADDY Awards winners. We are honored to be recognized among such fantastic creative work. Tonight we took home a silver ADDY for the work we did on [Red Roots Yoga's website](https://redrootsyoga.com/). We'd definitely like to thank Russ Thomas and Rosalie Pierman, who are the co-founders over at Red Roots Yoga.

We're definitely not sober in any of these photos.
