After reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/doodles/comments/7nv5oh/i_doodle_a_little_memory_every_day_in_a_calendar/) on reddit, I decided it would be cool to have my design students try this project out. The results from month one are great and I wanted to share them on here. You can definitely see the wide variety in the student's personal styles. It's going to be interesting to see how these develop throughout the rest of the semester.
