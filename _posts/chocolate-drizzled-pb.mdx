When we're between projects here at Pixel Bakery we like to work on personal projects to better our animation and graphic design skills. Jordan took over 300 hours to create this animation using cinema 4D and a particle dynamics program called RealFlow.

The first part of creating any motion design is sketching what you want the final project to look like. Putting your ideas to paper gives you much needed direction once you open your software and start designing. After finalizing your concept, the next step is to create a model in cinema 4D. In this case, Jordan designed the PB logo and the surrounding scene. Next, port the model over to RealFlow. This program allows you to tell the particles how to behave. You can dictate how gooey the chocolate droplets are, how they respond to gravity, and how many particles to generate. It took over 120 hours to simulate this animation, as each particle of chocolate is unique. Then, using a particle mesh, Jordan grouped the particles and created a grid connecting the droplets as the fell. Think of this as finally putting the drywall on a framed house.

Once the droplets have been configured to your liking, bring the whole simulation back into Cinema 4D to add textures, lighting elements and all other final details. Finally, render your finished project. In total, this 15 second animation took over 300 hours to create. While this may seem crazy to some, it's important to us that we use our free time to improve our skills so we can give our clients the best services possible. The best part of being a motion studio is being able to work on fun projects like this while simultaneously building our brand.

If you have questions or are interested in creating animations like this shoot us an email, we love helping out creatives in our community! Also check out this animation on our [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/pixelbakerylnk).
