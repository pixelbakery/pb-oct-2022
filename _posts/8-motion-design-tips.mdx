Coming from a graphic design background, I know all the basic graphic design resource sites: the Dieline, AIGA Eye on Design, It’s Nice That, etc. Recently, I had some time to dive into 2024 motion graphics trends, and I realized I had a harder time finding motion design resource sites than I do when I look for graphic design inspiration. Out of the goodness of my heart, I have decided to compile a list here for you. I hope these help you as much as they helped me.
