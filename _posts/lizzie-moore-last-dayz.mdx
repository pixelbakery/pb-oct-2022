Goodbyes are hard. It's always been that way for me, whether it's a family reunion or friends moving out of state. While I sit on the burnt orange couch reflecting on my time here at Pixel Bakery, all I can think about is how much I'm going to miss this place. These people are kind, funny, hard-working, and inspiring. I've learned so much from each of my colleagues and leaders that I'll be able to take with me wherever I end up. Yes, skills were developed, but relationships were too. Grabbing drinks at Tavern, taking fitness classes together, and planning a trip to Europe is only a handful of activities I did with my co-workers. There's a perfect balance between getting shit done and having fun. 

I won't forget my time here. My advice to those who are thinking about working here is to send in an application. This job gives you experiences you never would've thought you could be a part of and experiences you learn from with guidance from mentors who are passionate about their jobs. I now have had experience being a production assistant on shoots, editing an episode for a TV show, making fun reels for our Instagram, and so much more.

To simply put it, goodbyes are hard, but for good reason. I have never cried when leaving a job.
