We’ve all been there- whether the client gave you a rushed timeline, or you procrastinated and now you have hours worth of footage to go through. No matter whose fault it is, here’s 6 tips to speed up your workflow and meet the deadline with plenty of time to spare.

## 1- Editing starts before you even touch the computer

Shoot in off speed- for timelapse or slow motion shots, playback will occur in whatever your project frame rate is, getting rid of the need to adjust the speed of every clip in post. Additionally, shoot lots of short clips rather than few long clips. If you shoot shorter clips, not only will you save storage space, you’ll have less footage to go through and get rid of.

## 2- Set yourself up for success

While it may be tempting to just dump all your files, keeping a strict file management system will be helpful in the long run. No re-linking, no messed up file pathing, no missing clips, etc. Set up separate folders for separate days, cameras, or content type (ex: interview vs. broll).

Make sure your project sequence is in the right aspect ratio, correct FPS, correct color space, etc. It’s super easy to change in the beginning, but can mess up your whole project if you have to change it later on.

## 3- Avoid the Spinning Wheel of Death

If you shoot with large file types (4k, raw, etc.), your computer can get bogged down easily. Many NLE softwares will automatically generate and link proxy files for your clips. Proxies are a lower resolution, compressed file of your hi-res footage. When you export, the files will automatically be replaced with your original source footage, but while editing, you won’t encounter the spinning wheel of death quite as frequently.

## 4- Click Click Click

On average, a person click a mouse 5 million times in their lifetime. Video editors probably double that- but using keyboard shortcuts remove the need to go back and forth from keyboard to mouse, saving lots of time in the long run. Every software has their own shortcuts, but you can easily customize keys to do what feels best to you.

## 5- Is AI going to take your job too?

Many NLE softwares have implemented a new technique called text-based editing. Specifically helpful for interviews or scripted shots, text-based editing enables the user to skim through the transcription and cut out mistakes, pauses, or only select a specific piece of dialogue. This cuts out the time spent scrolling through an hour-long clip when you only need one sentence. Don’t spend hours composing the perfect song, or searching for the right length. Use adobe’s auto-remix tool to simply click and drag a music track to the exact length of your video.

## 6- LUTs

While LUTs may not be the end-all solution to color grading, they can be helpful in a pinch. There are tons available for converting Log footage to Rec. 709, or applying an overall “look” to your footage. Create your own! If you shoot with consistent lighting or always go for a similar look, creating your own LUTs will make future projects go much quicker.
