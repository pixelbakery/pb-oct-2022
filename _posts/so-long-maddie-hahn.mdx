It’s with a heavy heart that I’m writing this goodbye letter to Pixel Bakery. It feels like just yesterday I was the new kid, typing out my bio and writing what my least favorite species of bird is (which is a woodpecker because I like my sleep). I’ve never had a job where I’ve grown and learned from so much. To be completely honest, I really didn’t know what I was jumping into *literally* they didn’t have a position to fill, but I ended up interviewing and somehow easing my way into making a Studio Manager position work. 

Our Associate Creative Director, [Samee](/about/samee-callahan), always says, “I didn’t ever think we needed a studio manager until you came along and now we can’t live without one.” If you are adaptable and willing to learn, there isn’t anything you won’t be able to do in life. I think anything can be taught; this position is a testament to that. I’ve learned everything from coding to being HR and running payroll to being a production assistant on a TV show and even brushing up on my home improvement skills. There’s never a dull moment; through this job I’ve realized how much I crave that spontaneity.

I’ve gained all these skills, but it’s the relationships that I’ll cherish most from my time at Pixel Bakery. It’s a place where like-minded people feel safe to be themselves and hold common interests that we can all geek out about. It’s a place filled with people who are kind, driven, incredibly talented, and totally unapologetically themselves. It’s a place that I’ll remember as a home. To everyone I’ve met through Pixel Bakery, you know who you are, and I’m keeping our memories close. * *wipes tears.* *

If you’re thinking about applying don’t hesitate because it’ll be the best decision you’ll ever make. You’ll gain experience you’ll take with you forever from brilliant mentors and creatives. You’ll form relationships, both personal and professional. But most importantly, you’ll get to know yourself a little more. 

I’ll always hold a place in my heart for those baking puns and the chaoticness that is Pixel Bakery. 

Until next time. ✌️
