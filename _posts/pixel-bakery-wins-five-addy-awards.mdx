Last weekend, Pixel Bakery was awarded two golds and three silvers in five different categories at the Nebraska ADDY Awards.

It's humbling to see our winning work alongside advertising giants like Swanson Russell and Bozell, but more than that, it's an honor to represent our clients for a second year in a row. To our clients: thank you for trusting your company's visual identity with a young group of passionate creatives. We can't wait to get back to work.

This year's results reinforced what we've already known: our services are focused and lean, our creative is innovative and forward thinking, and our strategy is rooted is in authenticity and simplicity. There isn't a creative agency in Nebraska that is as young or as small that has been more widely recognized for its work than us. Maybe that sounds self-centered or over-confident, but it's something I believe to be true and something I'm immensely proud of.

That being said, I don't want this to be a post just about award recognition, but rather a broader direct call to action:

Send us a message if you're a business owner looking for a creative team. Give us a call if you're a potential client looking for a *new* creative team. Fill out an application if you're a student looking for a summer internship. Send over your reel if you're a talented freelance artist. Let us know if you're an employee at another creative agency and looking to make a change.

We're looking forward to hearing from you.
