Currently, Jordan is going through a cyclical style period in his work where everything starts and ends in the same place. "Ski Lift" is a Roller Coaster Tycoon-inspired animation created entirely in Cinema 4D. It incorporates a recent industry trend: low poly design. 

Low poly design uses a small number of geometric shapes (cough cough polygons) to create a larger image. This type of design is appealing because of its dramatic simplicity. Low poly design got its start with 3D modeling for video games and is now gaining popularity in the art, design, and advertising worlds.

Here are some other low poly designs that we dig.
