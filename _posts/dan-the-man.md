Recently, we happily added another chef to our ever-growing pixel kitchen! Daniel Hinz is an award-winning illustrative artist in his final year at UNL, and we couldn't help but share his incredible [senior Capstone project](http://www.unldesign.com/2020-fall/daniel-hinz/) with you all. (Honestly, we just wanted to show him off... try not to get too jealous.)

Congrats on your gold-star Capstone, Dan. We love you and we can't believe how lucky we are to have you on the team. (P.S. Sick pre-quarantine beard.)

# Love,

# PB
