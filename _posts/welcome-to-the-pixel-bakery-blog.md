Hello poor, lost soul and welcome to our blog. Here we will post patronizing articles about how to make a Facebook status, how to zoom in on Instagram photos without liking them (pinch and zoom, don't double tap!), and the do's and don'ts of perfecting the perfect tweet for your target audience without segmenting the rest of your followers - no need to rock the boat.

But don't fret just yet. Keep reading!

We will, on occasion, have helpful tutorials on how we crafted our latest animation, articles highlighting cool features in programs like After Effects and Cinema 4D, noteworthy Pixel Bakery happenings, and leaked emails of top government officials.

Come back soon, but don't linger.
