This past Saturday, we were excited to accept a Gold AIGA award for work we created with our partners at KANEKO. Wrapping up in early 2018, the video we produced was a teaser for their Light exhibition. We shot footage around the museum the week before the exhibition was open to the public, including the infinity room - an enclosed room with floor to ceiling mirrors reflecting images from a projector. Other areas featured work previously on display at Burning Man and an interactive audiovisual piece curated by Circus Family and artist Refik Anandol. 

The exhibition saw record-breaking daily and overall attendance and was featured in publications like the Omaha World Herald, Creative Boom, and the Lincoln Journal Star.

This was our second year in a row one of our submissions was awarded a Gold at SHOW. Last year, a series of illustrations we did for a local photographer's website took home the Gold. Check out the video below and read more about the Light exhibition on our portfolio page.
