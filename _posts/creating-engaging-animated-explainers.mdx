In the fast-paced world of digital communication, animated explainer videos have become a powerful tool for businesses and content creators to convey their messages effectively. These engaging and dynamic visual narratives can simplify complex concepts, captivate audiences, and boost brand awareness. In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down the step-by-step process of creating a compelling animated explainer videoâ€”from scriptwriting to animation techniques.

## Understanding Animated Explainer Videos

Before diving into the creation process, let's understand what makes animated explainer videos so effective. These videos typically run between 60-90 seconds and use animation to break down complex ideas into digestible, engaging content. Companies like Dropbox, Spotify, and Airbnb have all used animated explainers to skyrocket their growthâ€”Dropbox famously increased conversions by 10% with their explainer video, resulting in 10 million new customers!

## Step 1: Define Your Goal and Target Audience
Before diving into the creative process, clearly define the goal of your animated explainer video. Whether it's to explain a product, introduce a service, or tell a brand story, a well-defined objective will guide your decisions throughout the production. Understand your target audience, their preferences, and the problems your video aims to solve.

Pro Tip: Create a detailed audience persona, including age range, interests, and pain points. For example, if you're targeting busy professionals aged 30-45, keep your video under 60 seconds and focus on efficiency-related benefits.

## Step 2: Craft a Killer Script
The foundation of any successful animated explainer video lies in a well-crafted script. Keep it concise, engaging, and focused on the key message. Address the problem, present the solution, and end with a strong call to action. A compelling script sets the tone for the entire production.

Script Writing Tips:
- Aim for 130-150 words per minute of video
- Start with a hook within the first 8 seconds
- Use conversational language (write how you speak)
- Include power words that trigger emotions
- Follow the proven Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) framework

## Step 3: Storyboarding
Translate your script into a visual roadmap through storyboarding. This step involves sketching out the key scenes and transitions, ensuring a smooth flow from start to finish. Storyboarding helps visualize the narrative, making it easier to identify potential issues before animation begins.

Recommended Tools:
- Boords: Great for professional storyboarding
- Storyboarder: Perfect for beginners (and it's free!)
- Milanote: Excellent for collaborative storyboarding

## Step 4: Choose the Right Animation Style
Selecting the appropriate animation style is crucial to conveying your message effectively. Each style has its own production time and budget implications:

1. 2D Animation
   - Cost: $$$
   - Timeline: 4-6 weeks
   - Best for: Most business explanations
   - Examples: Slack, Uber

2. Motion Graphics
   - Cost: $$
   - Timeline: 3-4 weeks
   - Best for: Data visualization, technical explanations
   - Examples: Apple, Google

3. Whiteboard Animation
   - Cost: $
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks
   - Best for: Educational content, step-by-step guides
   - Examples: RSA Animate series
## Step 5: Create Engaging Visuals
With the storyboard as your guide, start bringing your vision to life through animation. Pay attention to details, transitions, and the overall visual appeal. Use colors, graphics, and motion to enhance engagement, keeping in mind the tone and style established in earlier steps.

Animation Best Practices:
- Keep movements smooth and natural
- Use consistent branding elements
- Implement the 12 principles of animation
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Use transition effects sparingly

Recommended Animation Software:
- Adobe After Effects: Professional industry standard
- Vyond: User-friendly for beginners
- Renderforest: Cloud-based animation tool
- Blender: Free 3D animation software

## Step 6: Add Captivating Voiceovers and Soundtrack
A well-scripted narrative deserves a captivating voiceover. Choose a voice that complements your brand and resonates with your audience. For voiceover talent, consider platforms like:
- Voice123
- Voices.com
- Fiverr Pro

For music licensing:
- Artlist
- Epidemic Sound
- PremiumBeat

Audio Tips:
- Ensure high-quality recording (at least 44.1 kHz, 16-bit)
- Use noise reduction if needed
- Balance music volume (background music should be at -20dB)
- Add sound effects strategically

## Step 7: Technical Optimization
Consider these technical specifications for different platforms:

Social Media Platforms:
- Instagram: 1080 x 1080px (square), max 60 seconds
- YouTube: 1920 x 1080px, no time limit
- LinkedIn: 1920 x 1080px, max 10 minutes
- Twitter: 1920 x 1080px, max 2 minutes 20 seconds

File Formats:
- MP4 with H.264 codec for web
- WebM as an alternative format
- Aim for file sizes under 100MB for smooth playback
## Step 8: Include a Strong Call to Action
Every animated explainer video should conclude with a compelling call to action (CTA). Make it:
- Clear and direct
- Time-sensitive when possible
- Value-focused
- Visually prominent

Example CTAs:
- "Start your free trial today"
- "Download our app now - 50% off this week only"
- "Join 10,000+ satisfied customers"
## Step 9: Test and Gather Feedback
Before launching your video, gather feedback from a select audience. Use tools like:
- UserTesting.com for professional feedback
- Google Forms for customer surveys
- A/B testing different versions
- Heat mapping tools to track viewer engagement

Common Issues to Watch For:
- Unclear messaging
- Poor pacing
- Audio-visual misalignment
- Confusing transitions
- Weak call-to-action
## Step 10: Launch and Promote
Once you've fine-tuned your animated explainer video, it's time to launch and promote it across relevant channels. Create a comprehensive distribution strategy:

Distribution Channels:
- Website homepage
- Product pages
- Email campaigns
- Social media platforms
- YouTube ads
- Trade shows and presentations

Track These Metrics:
- View count and watch time
- Engagement rate
- Click-through rate
- Conversion rate
- Social shares
- Comments and feedback

## Budget Considerations

Here's what you can expect to spend:
- DIY: $500-2,000 (software, music, voiceover)
- Professional Studio: $3,000-20,000+
- Enterprise Level: $20,000-50,000+

Money-Saving Tips:
- Start with a tight script to minimize animation time
- Use template-based animation tools
- License royalty-free music
- Work with freelancers for specific tasks
