## Type Week 3: Semicolon

What's up, egg whites? Week 3 of the Nebraska Type Challenge had our participants designing the semicolon. This mark is one of great significance to many people due to the meaning it has taken in regards to mental health. The Semicolon Project has been ongoing in recent years and the website used by most of its followers states, "A semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you, and the sentence is your life."
