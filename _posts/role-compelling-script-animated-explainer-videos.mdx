A compelling script is the backbone of a captivating animated explainer video, driving the narrative forward, conveying your message, and keeping viewers engaged until the very end.
## Why Your Script Matters

*   **Before You Start**: Picture each shot fully before moving on – ensure they fit with one another and flow well!
