Sup!

My name is Lizzie and I'm the new Post-Production Apprentice here at Pixel Bakery!

I'm currently a senior at UNL studying Broadcast Journalism while minoring in Entrepreneurship. One of my dream jobs is to join a cool artist on tour and film/edit videos of their concerts, features at festivals, etc. I love music and video editing so combining the two only makes sense.

My entrepreneurial dream is to start my own clothing brand. I'm picky when it comes to buying clothes, so, why not just make my own. It would start with graphic tees, face masks, lighters, trucker hats, and stickers. Then I would eventually add clothing that fits the sophisticated streetwear ~aesthetic~.

Aside from my professional interests, I love to hammock, watch sunsets, make Spotify playlists (follow me lizzie13moore!!), watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians, cook (suck at baking tho), play piano, and adding items to my online cart that I don't even buy...just to name a few!

I also love traveling and had the opportunity to spend two weeks in Greece and Italy. My absolute favorite place to visit was Capri, Italy. the island was full of the kindest people, designer shops, yachts, celebrity mansions, etc. The food was also amazing.

Now that you know a little more about me, I'm ending this post with the wise words of Guy Fieri,

"That's all she wrote."
