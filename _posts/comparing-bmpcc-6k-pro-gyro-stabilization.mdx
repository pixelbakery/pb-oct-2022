New Blackmagic Camera/Davinci update means a new firmware update!

Camera Firmware 7.9 brings a new stabilizing method to Blackmagic Cameras. It uses the same feature that tells you when your camera is level, and saves that data to the footage, allowing you to stabilize it more effectively in post!

We decided to give this a go and do a quick test around the office to see whether it was worth the upgrade.

While it's no gimbal killer, the update is significantly better than the previous stabilization method: “Perspective.” It greatly reduces micro-jitters and lets us have a bit more peace of mind when shooting handheld when we need for run-and-gun style shoots. We've noticed that this works best when you have a subject to follow and shoot on a wider lens. This is due to the fact that the footage will crop in a bit to help stabilize.

It's a long-awaited feature on blackmagic cameras and they've knocked it out of the park.

Compatible with Davinci Resolve 18 & Camera Firmware 7.9.
