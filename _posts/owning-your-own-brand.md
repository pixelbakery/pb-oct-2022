I recently read "Boss Bitch" by Nicole Lapin. This book is all about how to strengthen your personal brand. When I first started to think about how to build my own personal brand I immediately thought about my social channels. I know that what I'm putting out there contributes to how others perceive me, and that itself encourages me to post content that truly represents me and what I care about. However, while social media is commonly a first impression to your brand (and an important piece!), I learned there's more you can build upon than just that.

Nicole stresses the importance of knowing your strengths and weaknesses, pinpointing exactly what you bring to the table. Knowing where you fall short can help you build upon those weaknesses, and conversely, you can use your strengths to "take" opportunities that open the door to bigger and better things. Confidence plays into this, as well. We've all heard the phrase "fake it till ya make it." This phrase can be life changing. Everyday at work isn't going to be a walk in the park, but you can own the mentality that you are your own boss and you make your own decisions.

Coming into Pixel Bakery, I was very nervous about proving myself and finding my place. As my time here comes to an end, I can see how much I've learned and grown as an advertising professional and I'm thankful for being pushed to do the best I can. I remember in the first month of my internship, I was in a client meeting and I had this overwhelming feeling that I was in the right place, pursuing the right career. Because of my growth at Pixel Bakery, I am more confident and excited to see where my advertising journey takes me.

Sherry Beck Paprocki once said, "If you don't brand yourself, Google will brand you." How scary is that? My advice is to take control of your brand, and set the standard for how people (including job recruiters!) see you. Try googling yourself and see what pops up. You can gain credibility in the marketplace by creating content such as blog posts and videos, therefore becoming a thought leader on topics you are passionate about. On top of this, it's important to diversify your skillset, as there is always something to learn. Lastly, try out things that scare you - overcoming your fear might be something that will bring you to the top of your game.

Owning my own brand is an ongoing process for me, but that's the way it should be. If you're a growing professional, your personal brand should reflect that. One of the best things I read in "Boss Bitch" was, "If you are persistent, you will get it, but if you're consistent, you will keep it." Being successful doesn't just come from executing one project really well - it means constantly striving for success and being ready to tackle the next challenge when it pops up. That being said, don't burn yourself out. Know your limits and value your time. You are the storyteller of your life.
