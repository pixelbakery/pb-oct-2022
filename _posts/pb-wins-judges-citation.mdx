I’m so thrilled to tell the world that Pixel Bakery won its first Judge’s Citation this year at the Nebraska ADDYs. The award was granted for [Onyx Coffee Lab](http://onyxcoffeelab.com)’s [Coffee Process Animation](/work/case-studies/onyx-coffee-process-animation).

This award serves as a reminder that, as a business owner, you should always hire people that are better than you. Surround yourself with a great team, and the sky is the limit.

Pixel Bakery is nothing without our team, so I’d like to thank my team for doing such a fantastic job with this project. Danny Hinz for his animation skill, Rebecca Cook for her insane illustration prowess, and Samee Callahan for her unwavering creative direction. 

[Danny](/about/dan-hinz): Your animation skills will never not amaze me. Your ability to see the big picture and put all of the *\*literal\** moving parts together is astonishing.

[Rebecca](/about/rebecca-cook): You’re the best damn illustrator I’ve ever met in my life, and I’m so fortunate to have you as our concept artist/ Cheery Person in Residence.

[Samee](/about/samee-callahan): Thank you so much for all you do. Your leadership and creative direction a huge part of Pixel Bakerys identity and why clients keep coming back and trust us with their brand.

We also received a gold award for our website design. I’m terrible at self-praise, hence why it’s a footnote, but I AM pretty proud of myself for it. Our website took me over a year to build, and I went from not knowing much about Javascript to being fluent in ReactJS.

I’d also like to give a huge shoutout to [Rachel](/about/rachel-dempsey), our visual designer, for raking it in on her personal awards. She bagged two golds and a Judge’s Citation of her own. She’s fresh out of college and already killing it with her field. I knew you were one of the best when I hired you ;)

So, again, thank you team- you are the oars that move this boat forward and I will never be not humbled and grateful of your dedication to the work we do.
