Hey! Kaden here, just wanted to drop in and introduce myself. I have been working as studio manager here at PB since November! I would’ve introduced myself sooner but I’m actually really mysterious. (I forgot)

Oops!

## Alexa, play *Best of Both Worlds* by Hannah Montana 🎶

I’ve spent the last 6 months bestie-ing it up with the team, buying cheese sticks, and offering my unsolicited opinions. I’ve helped put together a couple community events, social media projects, and sat in on meetings to take notes and help strategize. My special skill is desperately trying to entertain the people around me when I should be writing emails… or blog posts.

Honestly though I am loving Pixel so far, my position as studio manager is a blend of administrative work, client outreach, and creative strategy. It’s given me a really well rounded understanding of the production process from conception to final revisions. I get to float around between the administrative and creative teams and learn new skills, tips, and tricks from everyone in the office.

## Weaponizing my BFA 👨🏻‍🎓

Outside of Pixel I study Emerging Media Arts at UNL. In school I create interactive projection installations and design projections for live performances. There’s lots of strategic content planning, audio/visual design, and technical troubleshooting happening in my classes. I’m graduating in December and I’m so ready, school is great and all but I miss having free time - and sleeping.

Seriously, if I have to write another discussion post I might throw up.

I love spending time at home. Like I said, school takes a lot out of me so there’s nothing better to me than doom scrolling on the couch or watching drag race like it’s a baby sensory video. My boyfriend and I have two cats named Thumbs and Venus. Thumbs has big eyes, big paws, and a bit of an anxiety disorder. He looks and acts like a Pixar movie character and I love that for him. We are besties despite his attachment issues, polydactyl KING!

## That's all I’ve got!

Thanks for taking the time to read a little bit more about me and my “new” gig. Feel free to follow me on instagram [@kadnegarcia](https://www.instagram.com/kadnegarcia) but dont expect me to post more than one photo dump per year. I should probably get back to it, I have some very important studio managing to do - Rachel isnt going to bug herself!
