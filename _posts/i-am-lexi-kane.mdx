Hey hi hello, I am little miss Pixel Bakery‚Äôs newest baker and hail all the way from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. My name is Alexia Kane but you can call me Lexi (I would actually prefer it, no one ever calls me Alexia). I‚Äôm going to be Pixel Bakery‚Äôs Community Manager, which means I‚Äôll be the one out and about at networking events and trying to connect the bakery and the community. I‚Äôll also be doing some business development and creative strategy stuff.

Here is a little bit about me to get us a little better acquainted!

## I am Charli XCX‚Äôs biggest stan üé∂

A few years ago, my friend Daniel introduced me to musical genius Charlotte Emma Aitchison, better known by her stage name Charli XCX. Most people know her from her pop hits Boom Clap, I Love It, and Fancy, but her discography is so much more than that! I am begging you to listen to Pop 2 and Number 1 Angel ASAP. I have the deluxe CRASH album cover tattooed on my left thigh. She is everything to me.

Apart from Charli, I listen Coco & Clair Clair, Caroline Polachek, Doja Cat, Rina Sawayama, Megan thee Stallion, Shygirl, Flo Milli, Rosalia, MUNA, Baby Tate, COBRAH, Djo, the 1975, TWICE, NewJeans‚Ä¶ I could go on for hours but I won‚Äôt xoxo

## I‚Äôm a Wisconsinite üßÄ

I was born in Madison, grew up in Green Bay, and moved to Eau Claire in 2017 for college. I‚Äôve only ever lived in Wisconsin! This is my first move out of state. People usually ask if I like the Green Bay Packers and I will be the first to tell you I actually don‚Äôt care about them at all. Call me when they‚Äôre in the Super Bowl or something, otherwise keep it to yourself! 

I don‚Äôt really claim my Wisconsin heritage, but I feel like it‚Äôs one of those things that I can talk badly about but if I hear someone talking bad on Wisconsin‚Äôs name I might clap back. It‚Äôs a lot like my relationship with my little brother; I‚Äôm allowed to bully him but no one else is.

## I love a good vendor market üé® #shoplocal !

In Eau Claire, I was involved with the [Eau Claire Makers Market](https://www.ecmakersmarket.com), which was a semi-monthly vendor market that provided local makers and artists an opportunity to sell their work and connect with the growing community. I love giving back to the community and getting involved, which is part of why I accepted this position here. I am excited to learn more about the arts and get more involved with the community here!

## I freelance model (idk if there‚Äôs an emoji for this)

Over this past year or so, I have been doing a lot of modeling in Minneapolis and almost even signed to an agency! I‚Äôve been taking photos with friends for fun but got genuinely interested in modeling in November 2022-ish. I have walked in two fashion shows and even directed one in Eau Claire that sold out in two weeks #flex.  It‚Äôs currently my favorite form of creative expression and experimentation. If you or anyone you know is into editorial photography, hit me up! You can check out my stuff on my Instagram [@alexiaalaurenn](https://instagram.com/alexiaalaurenn)

## I have the stinkiest dog in the world

My beagle mix, Winston, is a big stinker. He has eyes that look two different directions, kind of like a frog. One time I went to the vet and he asked why Winston was so greasy. I said I thought beagles were supposed to be a little greasy and the vet looked at me and said ‚Äúnot this greasy‚Äù. I love him dearly but he can be a total pill. He recently ate an entire bag of Dove milk chocolate which was a fun vet visit. Everyone at the vet office told me he had great taste in chocolate. It would be more endearing if chocolate wasn‚Äôt toxic to dogs!

Anyway, that‚Äôs me I guess. Say hi if you see me out and about!

xoxo,
Lexi Kane ‚ù§Ô∏è
