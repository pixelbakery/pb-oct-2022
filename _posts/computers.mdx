## At Pixel Bakery

I feel like one of my talents is that I am a very competent leader who is good at spotting talent. Unfortunately in private, I am a bit of a ditz. At the office, I tend to be very organized, on time, and create clear lines of communication. Home is a totally different story - my husband is the organized one and I am the chaotic mess! 

I love working at Pixel Bakery because I am passionate about supporting creatives and their work. In my past experience, I have worked exclusively with traditional artists- helping them curate shows, sell work, and grow their practices. At PB, I get to do that all in support of a team whose talents are vast and incredibly admirable. 

I don't really know much about design applications or computers - I am constantly asking my husband to fix something I've broken or dropped in the bathtub- but I have enjoyed learning the process of animation and videography. I assist the team in organizing onsite shoots and have had the opportunity to meet so many different people that I would never have before. From environmental biologists to farm cats, every experience has been a treasure. 

I am so excited to see what I will learn in the future, I hope that I can continue to grow my skills and meet more talented people!
