I recently ran into an issue where I wanted to use NextJS's image optimization feature to display several images from Instagram.

NextJS requires you to define any domains you want to use for images in nextjs.config.js ahead of time. There's a ton of security reasons why this is important, but Instagram tumbles their cdn subdomain at random, so there's no way to account for every subdomain.

Unfortunately, as of right now, NextJS also prohibits the use of wildcard subdomains. In the future, it would be great to have the ability to add `[https://*.cdninstagram.com](https://pixelbakery.medium.com/*.cdninstagram.com)` or add a fallback url.

I did, however, notice that all of Instagram's CDN subdomains are valid. The images are not specifically stored on a single subdomain. You can replace the subdomain with any of their other ones and it still works.

There doesn't seem to be a lot out there focused on a workaround, so here's what I came up with:

In your nextJS.config.js file:

`images: { domains: [ 'scontent-akl1-1.cdninstagram.com', ], }`
Out of the box, this isn't enough. It might work for a day, but it'll expire.

When we call the image, we can replace the subdomain URL:

`<Image fill={true} className='object-cover w-full h-full instagram-image' key={index} src={item.media_url.replace(/^[^.]/, 'https://scontent-akl1-1')} alt={item.caption} quality={33}/>`
And it works!

## Conclusion

It's terribly frustrating that there isn't a better method of doing this. The only other option I discovered wasÂ [this medium post](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/next-js-how-to-proxy-to-backend-server-987174737331), which requires you to add an api request to set a proxy. I couldn't get it to work, which I'm sure is on me, so this solution was the best answer.

It should be noted that this DOES open you up to security vulnerabilities, but they're negligible since we're using the same main domain (cdn.instagram.com).
