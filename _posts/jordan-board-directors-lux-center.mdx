I’m super pumped to announce that I’ve accepted a position on the Board of Directors for the [LUX Center for the Arts](https://www.luxcenter.org). As anyone who’s close to me will tell you, providing creative and cultural equity in Lincoln (and all of Nebraska) is something that I’ve dedicated a large part of my life to. Building a community centered around access to art, creative minds, and art education doesn’t just make Lincoln a better place to live — it puts us on the map. It’s what will turn Nebraska from a flyover state to the cultural epicenter of the nation. I’m a firm believer that the talent and mindset is already here; all we need is access and an open environment to flourish.

I’m so honored to have been invited to serve on a board with like-minded individuals, who not only share the same mission, but have the arsenal, motivation, and network to accomplish it. I can’t wait to dig in and get to work.

LUX Center for the Arts is truly Lincoln's community arts center, a vital resource for the visual arts in Nebraska.

The LUX offers year-round art classes for children, youth, and adults in ceramics, painting, drawing, glass, mixed media, and metals/jewelry. The quality of instruction sets the LUX apart. Classes are taught by artists/teachers in our Artist-in-Residence program, which each year brings four professional, well-educated, emerging artists/teachers to Lincoln to teach, in exchange for studio space, materials, and a solo exhibition.
