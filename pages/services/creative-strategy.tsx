          From the initial discovery meeting to the final deliverable, our leadership team at Pixel
          Bakery is all about strategizing the best way to deliver your message. Before any
          pre-production on a project begins, PB develops a communication strategy and creative
          brief based on a client&apos;s goals, pain points, and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between a client&apos;s invaluable knowledge of their brand and our dedication to
          providing a homogeneous brand experience from start to finish, PB knows that a unifying
          theme that ties a project together is the key to a successful campaign.
