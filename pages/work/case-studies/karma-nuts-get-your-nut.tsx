We came in to spread the word about this tasty snack by creating a brand video that highlights all its awesome benefits. The goal was to create a cool and colorful 30-second, e-commerce animation that Karma Nuts could place to quickly tell the story of their products. Using the mandala-shaped logo as inspiration, we wanted to play with all the different flavors of nuts intertwining while giving it a bohemian flare.'
