In today's tutorial, I will show you how I created my box of crayons on an isometric grid. So first, you're going to start out with a new Illustrator file. You're going to go to preferences under Illustrator. Go to general. I'm just going to set it up as 0.125 inches. And then if you tab over, it'll change it to pixels.

And then you're going to do 0.38 inches and tab over again. And then hit enter. And now you're just going to create a line. If you hold shift, it'll make it straight. Select the line and hold shift + alt. And then hold the right arrow key down, and it will just copy and paste that all the way over.

And then you can zoom out and just kind of go across your entire layout. And then go ahead and select all of them. You can just make it taller so it's easier for us to work with. And then you can go ahead and group them. And then you go ahead and copy and then go ahead and paste it in place.

Then we're going to use the rotation tool. And then go ahead and type in 60 and enter. Copy, paste in place. Go ahead and hit object, transform, reflect, vertical. Hit okay. So now you have an isometric grid. And we're just going to clean it up a little bit by selecting it all.

And you can scale it however you want so it fits nicely within your page. Make it a little bit bigger, depending on how you want your grid, and what size you want it. And then you can group that together. And then I just kind of create a shape, same size as my page.

And then we can create a clipping mask so that we can get rid of that extra. And there you have it, your isometric grid. And then you can turn the opacity down so that it's more of a light gray so that you can see what you're doing. But that is it. An isometric grid.
