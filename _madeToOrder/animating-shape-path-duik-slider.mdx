Learn how to animate your designs, like an umbrella, using path keyframes and the DUIK slider tool for a unique tween effect.

## **1. Setting Up the Project**

### **a. Importing Layers:**

- Start by importing your files, ensuring they **retain layer sizes**.
- Navigate to `Comp 1`.
- Drag and drop your **open umbrella layers** into the comp.
  
### **b. Working with Illustrator Files:**

- Once inside the comp, you will begin with the center panel of the umbrella.
- If your layer is an Illustrator file (or a vector Illustrator file), you'll want to convert this to a shape layer.
  - Right-click on the layer.
  - Select `Create Shapes From Vector Layer`.
  - Delete the original Illustrator layer for cleanliness.

### **c. Aligning Reference Layers:**

- For the next step, bring in the **closed front center panel** of the umbrella.
- This will be your reference.
- Align the tops of the closed and open panels. To do this:
  - Go to `View` and select `Show Rulers`.
  - Place a ruler at the center of the top of the open umbrella.
  - Use `Shift` to snap the closed panel to this center point.

## **2. Animating with Path Keyframes**

### **a. Setting up Path Keyframes:**

- Expand the layer settings: `Contents` > `Group` > `Path`.
- Before setting path keyframes, ensure both your closed and open paths have a **matching number of anchor points**.
- If they donâ€™t match, you have two options:
  1. Adjust in the Illustrator file.
  2. Use the `Pen tool` in After Effects to add an anchor point.
  
- Once consistent, click on the stopwatch icon to set the initial path keyframe.
  
### **b. Adjusting the Path:**

- Move a few seconds forward in the timeline.
- Adjust the anchor points of the open panel to match the closed position.
- Modify the handles for smooth transitions.

## **3. Implementing the DUIK Slider**

### **a. Accessing the DUIK Tool:**

- Navigate to `Window` and open the **DUIK panel**.
- Go to `Links and Constraints` and open the `Advanced Connected tab`.
- Create a slider console. 

### **b. Connecting the Slider:**

- Rename the newly created shape layer to "slider".
- Adjust the slider's position for optimal animation.
- Highlight the path keyframes on your umbrella layer.
- Use the `Connect to Properties` option in the DUIK panel to bind your shape layer to the slider.
  
### **c. Looping the Animation:**

- For continuous, repeated animation, utilize the `loop out time` function:
  - Drop down the `position menu`.
  - Navigate to `property`.
  - Select `loop out time equals cycle`. Set the number of keyframes to zero.

## **4. Extending the Animation to Other Panels**

Repeat the process detailed above for all panels or sections of your design that you want to animate. Remember to:

- Convert each panel to a shape from the vector.
- Align using guide rulers.
- Set and adjust path keyframes.
- Connect each to the DUIK slider.

## **5. Final Touches**

- Once all panels are animated, you can add additional details like color schemes, handles, and other design elements to finalize your animation.

## **Conclusion**

And there you have it! Your animated design is now ready, moving seamlessly between the open and closed states using path keyframes and the DUIK slider tool. This method offers an efficient way to create stop motion or tween effects in After Effects. We hope you found this tutorial useful and can't wait to see what you create!
