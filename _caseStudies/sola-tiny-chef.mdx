<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Bringing a Tiny Chef with big, keto-friendly ideas to life."}>

The SOLA Company is a low-carb, low-sugar, keto-friendly brand that came to Pixel Bakery looking to make an animated explainer video showcasing their bread.

We had previously worked with SOLA in the live-action realm and were extremely excited to see what we could do for them within another specialty of ours - animation.

The live-action portion of this project consisted of hiring a production crew to assist in bringing the Tiny Chef Magic to life. The video production team included a director, gaffer, grip, assistant camera, and a FOOD STYLIST (how legit). Maria Smal, Pixel Bakery's social media manager, was pegged as the perfect candidate to be cast as the homeowner for the video.
