<CaseStudiesIntro title={'Rise to the Top of the Flapjack Stack'}>
  
In Q2 of 2022, Kodiak Cakes will be named the #1 flapjack company in the country. It’s a HUGE deal. The brand formerly known as Aunt Jemima held this title for years. Kodiak was told by Shark Tank that they’d never make it, and they’ve done far more than that.

This video will celebrate that fact by going through the timeline of how Kodiak got here and, in the end, will announce the trip that their whole team gets to go on together.

On the flip side, we’re going to take that employee-facing video and make a customer-facing video out of it. Instead of ending with the trip announcement, it will end with the #1 Flapjack announcement.
