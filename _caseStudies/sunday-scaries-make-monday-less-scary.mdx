<CaseStudiesIntro title={"How to Make Videos About Making Monday Less Scary"}>

Sunday Scaries approached us wanting a campaign to promote their CBD product. The goal was to create something lighthearted, quick/snappy, but serious about their product. The campaign was directed towards social media, which means we only had 10 seconds max to grab our audience's attention.
