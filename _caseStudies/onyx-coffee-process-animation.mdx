<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Showing the world what makes ONYX different"}>

This animation takes the viewer on a journey through ONYX's unique coffee process. In 45-seconds, we outline a the major points that set ONYX apart from competitors: quality/excellence, transparency, and sustainability. The goal for this project was to increase awareness of ONYX to the mass consumer and drive new coffee subscriptions.

We catered this project towards a direct-to-consumer audience. Not “coffee people”, as is their usual customer. The consumers we're talking to are peopple who are interested in **good coffee** and **ethical practices** at whatever the cost. This audience may have no experience with ONYX yet, so we introduce them to the whole concept of their business.

**Key Message:** ONYX is the highest quality coffee made ethically and with sustainable practices.

        ## Process

        As the audience is taken on a tour of Onyx’s story and values through the narration, Pixel Bakery guides the audience through a series of flowing illustrations. To start, Onyx has a very strong visual voice comprised of crisp lines on smoothly flowing shapes. It speaks to their dedication to being simply the best.

        Our team chose to compliment that vision with gritty texture gradients and swooping color blocks, introducing some organic movement and texture into this sleek imagery.

        This successfully came together with our team's dedication to beautiful, animated choreography and always taking "good" and making it "excellent."
