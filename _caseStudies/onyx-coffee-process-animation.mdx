<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Showing the world what makes ONYX different"}>

This animation takes the viewer on a journey through ONYX's unique coffee process. In 45-seconds, we outline a the major points that set ONYX apart from competitors: quality/excellence, transparency, and sustainability. The goal for this project was to increase awareness of ONYX to the mass consumer and drive new coffee subscriptions.

We catered this project towards a direct-to-consumer audience. Not “coffee people”, as is their usual customer. The consumers we're talking to are peopple who are interested in **good coffee** and **ethical practices** at whatever the cost. This audience may have no experience with ONYX yet, so we introduce them to the whole concept of their business.

**Key Message:** ONYX is the highest quality coffee made ethically and with sustainable practices.
