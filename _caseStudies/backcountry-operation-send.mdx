<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Capturing a workplace culture that seeks to send it."}>

We created a sizzle reel for Backcountry’s culture that they’ve dubbed Operation Send. In one week’s time, we took user-generated content and created an exciting peek into the outdoor enthusiast culture that permeates Backcountry.

Given a week’s time to create this video, we first dove deep to find solid inspiration. We then cultivated a look and feel through style frames that were signed off on by the client. To expedite the process, our creative director designed out each frame’s composition while our animator brought them to life. The teamwork, talent, and communication skills behind this project led to a final product that the entire PB team was proud to stand behind.
