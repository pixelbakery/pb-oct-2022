<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Navigating Sensitive Topics with Empathy and Hope"}>
In a collaborative project with the University of Nebraska Public Policy Center, our team was tasked with creating a series of educational videos for Safe2Help, a confidential reporting system designed to protect student and school safety in Nebraska.

The Safe2Help video series successfully educated its target audience, effectively communicating the program's purpose and process. The project enhanced community safety and trust in Nebraska's schools by presenting Safe2Help as a reliable, caring, and essential resource.

Our approach in producing these videos demonstrated the power of empathetic and clear communication in addressing sensitive issues and fostering a safe educational environment. Through this collaboration, we reinforced the importance of understanding and caring in community-building initiatives.

The primary objective was to present Safe2Help as a hopeful, informative, and supportive tool, not as a punitive measure. The videos aimed to clarify the program's purpose, usage, and follow-up procedures, fostering a safe and caring school environment.

Each video included Safe2Help's branding and logos of project partners, like the Nebraska Department of Education and Boystown, to emphasize collaboration and trust. The videos were crafted to be hopeful, informative, relatable, and conversational, aligning with the program's empathetic and supportive nature.

Video 1 explained the purpose of Safe2Help and the reporting process, assuring students they would be speaking to trained crisis counselors, not law enforcement or school counselors. Video 2 was tailored for guardians, this video highlighted how Safe2Help could be a resource for them and their children. Videos 3 & 4 detailed the signs to watch for in struggling students, the nature of bullying, and the steps following a tip submission.
