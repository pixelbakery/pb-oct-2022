<CaseStudiesIntro title={"A rebranding launch video that’s honestly a real tear-jerker"}>

Working with a local ad agency, [Firespring](https://firespring.com), we put our forces (for good) together to tell their client’s story by using a hybrid of [animation](/services/animation) and video production. [Solutions for Change](https://solutionsforchange.org) had recently rebranded and this video was a huge part of the rebrand launch. It was posted on a landing page and [social media](/services/social-media) that garnered tons of attention and lots of donations. 

**Industry:** [Nonprofit Organizations](/industries/nonprofit-video)

### Process
For this video we really got to flex our motion graphics muscles. We were given the script, the brand elements, and some video clips then went straight to the storyboard. We came back with an emotional masterpiece that was a game-changer not only for the external audiences, but for the morale of their entire internal team.
