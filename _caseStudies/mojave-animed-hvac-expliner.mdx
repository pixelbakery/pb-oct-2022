Mojave specializes in cutting-edge liquid desiccant systems aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and mitigating the environmental impact of HVAC operations. Their flagship product, a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) tailored for commercial structures, prioritizes dehumidification, thus reducing energy consumption and reliance on refrigerants while elevating indoor air quality standards.

Mojave's liquid desiccant technology facilitates precise control over dew point and dry bulb setpoints, resulting in superior efficiency and a more favorable total cost of ownership compared to competing DOAS solutions. Moreover, ongoing research and development endeavors hold the promise of achieving an impressive 80% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional vapor compression systems, along with the elimination of refrigerants, which could significantly curtail carbon dioxide emissions by over one billion tons.
