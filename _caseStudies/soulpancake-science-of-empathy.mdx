<CaseStudiesIntro title={''}>

After working with them on another series intro animation, SoulPancake came to us to create the intro and individual episode animations for their popular series "Science Of." This season consisted of eight episodes, all about empathy. We were tasked with creating imagery that described the complex emotion while still being fun and engaging.
