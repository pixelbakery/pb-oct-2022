<CaseStudiesIntro title={'Making Rural Broadband a Priority'}>

Imagine you live in a world where 29% of U.S. farms have no internet access at all. Welcome to reality.
  
The American Soybean Association approached us to create an animated video that highlights the key findings from a survey on rural broadband. We created this video with the goal to inform the public on the importance of this issue. 

**Industry:** [Nonprofits Animation](/industries/nonprofit-video)

### Process

Our take on this video was to not just throw numbers and facts at the viewer but to tell a story through our visuals. These custom illustrations are relatable to the target audience and are just delightful to look at.
