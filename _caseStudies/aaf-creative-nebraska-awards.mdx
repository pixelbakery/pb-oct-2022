<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Making Air Conditioning ~Aesthetic~"}>
Pixel Bakery was approached by local production company, [Story Find Films](https://storyfind.com/about), who wanted us to create the theme for the 2024 Creative Nebraska awards. This was an exciting opportunity to develop something completely from scratch, without too many constraints from the client. We took this opportunity to push creative boundaries, express ourselves as creatives, and have a collaborative experience with each other. The theme we decided on was an homage to creativity in advertising, and we used different styles of animation to represent the diversity of creative styles within advertising.

We utilized a mixed media approach, featuring video, motion graphics, collage, and more to bring the welcome video to life. Every member of our team was able to contribute in some way, which was important for our team to finally have that level of collaboration.
