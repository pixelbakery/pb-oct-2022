<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Opening the door to better digital parenting."}>
When parents need insight into their kids' social media world, most apps play bad cop. Not Socialeyez. They came to Pixel Bakery for a 90-second animated explainer video that would showcase their different approach. Our 2D animation and storytelling captures their core mission: helping families tackle the digital world together, not from opposite sides. Through engaging visuals and clear messaging, we created an animated explainer that proves digital parenting doesn't have to feel like surveillance.

<CaseStudiesDescription className='text-cream' textColor={'cream'} bgColor={'blue-dark'} headerColor={'blue'} header={'Process'}>
<p className="text-cream">Our video needed to communicate Socialeyez as a relational tool rather than a surveillance app. The core message was to portray it as "Digital Driver's Ed" for social media, emphasizing its role in educating both parents and children about digital autonomy with safety guardrails.</p>

<p className="text-cream">Being a new and evolving brand, Socialeyez presented us with the unique opportunity to influence its brand aesthetics. The challenge was to convey serious content with an upbeat tone, symbolizing the opening of new doorways in digital parenting.</p>
