<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Turning (Gear)heads with motion graphic magic for the esteemed outdoor retailer, Backcountry."}>

Backcountry, an online specialty retailer known for selling the highest-performing outdoor gear, reached out to Pixel Bakery, in need of logo, typeface, and customer experience animations to supplement a series of four YouTube ads for their brand.

The deliverables to each video were to be unique, as each closing logo animation was a subtle nod to a different outdoor industry.

Testimonial from client:

> Please pass this message along to the broader team. I cannot thank you and your team enough for the collaboration on this project. The animations look absolutely fantastic and everyone that has seen the videos are blown away. I appreciate your willingness to be nimble and adjust on the fly. This project would not have come together without Pixel Bakery and I am eternally grateful. A million thanks.

Since these ads move so quickly, Pixel Bakeryâ€™s main objective was to produce tasteful, quick animations that were punchy, natural, and memorable.

With a tight turnaround time of just under two weeks, the team immediately got to work. Multiple directional concepts were provided for each animation, giving the client a chance to see a handful of options for each deliverable before narrowing down their selections.
