<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Adding animation and character design to Marq's rebrand."}>


Marq is a brand templating platform made for non-designers. At the crossroads of intuitive design and powerful brand management, you’ll find Marq.

With this [animated explainer video](/services/animated-explainer-videos) (among other assets), Marq is officially leaving its old name (Lucidpress) behind and launching into a new era. It was our job to bring that new brand to life. The animation walks users through key features and benefits, and introduces the new brand. 

Our goal for this project was for the viewer to walk away knowing exactly who Marq is as a company, and what the product does both literally and figuratively for its audience (literal: brand templating, figurative: easy-to-use so makes your life easier). 

Working in unison with the client’s creative team during pre-production, the PB team offered creative consultation. Once the script, VO, and music was wrapped, we dove into storyboarding. Our goal was to make this brand stand out from other tech brands. Queue: the dancing blobsters. With a fun, splashy color palette and just the most chef’s kiss animation, this explainer video hits the Marq, without a doubt.
