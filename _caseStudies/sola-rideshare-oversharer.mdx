<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Using dry-humor to create something for a new demographic that's choosing healthier options."}>

The SOLA company came to us to create a 60-second [video commercial](/services/video-production) that would promote their low-carb, keto-friendly bread. They needed something that would appeal to their millennial demographic: hopefully combining dry humor with a relatable scenario to today’s young adult.

</CaseStudiesIntro>

<CaseStudiesDescription textColor={'cream'} bgColor={'pink-lighter'} headerColor={'pink'} header={'Process'}>

To bring an awkward Uber ride to life, you’ve gotta film in a moving car. Not the easiest task. Luckily, our small but mighty team works well in tight spaces.

We brought in a few reinforcements for an extra hand with lighting, filming, makeup, and assistance on set. We lucked out and found two local actors perfect for the Uber driver and his unfortunate passenger, and both were ready and willing to drive around in circles for hours and brave the bitter, Nebraska winter. We’ve got to give extra props to Kabin (the Driver) for his execution of the script, but also being able to ad-lib beautifully when we needed him to. Much of what made the final cut was made up on the spot.

Authenticity was key with this project, and we felt a green screen just wouldn’t do the scene justice. Instead, we were able to mount a Black Magic Pocket Cinema 4k on the hood of the car to get shots through the windshield, and then inside the car for some additional angles. We directed via walkie talkies and followed in a car. Many people were crammed in trunks. Our mothers disapproved. Exciting stuff!

Don’t forget about the real reason we’re all here, though: bread. We crafted trays of sandwiches for the perfect ending shot, and put our creative team to the task of food styling (it’s not easy.) If half of our time was spent in the trunk of a moving car for this commercial, the other half was spent watching Nathan trying to blissfully eat sandwich after sandwich until we told him to stop. (Sorry, Nathan.)
