                    Verdi already has killer branding, and we wanted to contribute something new in this animation. We created a bird character to add a little extra pathos to a lot of statistical information, and to emphasize Verdi’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

          Once the project was complete, Pixel Bakery used the animation assets to design a web banner for Verdi.com’s homepage. This effectively tied together the explainer video with the rest of Verdi’s branding.

 **From the Client:**

"I couldn't picture the experience going much better in all honesty! 

All around a fantastic experience! Pixel Bakery makes me feel like I'm working with real trusted experts and the final product clearly proves that! They had a crystal-clear understanding of our goal and did an incredible job portraying our brand. We are almost certainly going to work with them again in the future for more video needs."
