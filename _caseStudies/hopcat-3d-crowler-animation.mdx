<CaseStudiesIntro title={'Our First National Client Ever ðŸ¤©'}>

We traveled to two different HopCat restaurants to do a series of videos. We went south to Kansas City to capture their opening day spectacle and finished up in Lincoln to create a line cleaning [process video](/services/video-production) and a psycadelia infused crowler promo.

Traveling out of the state for shoots like this is one of our favorite things; we love all the amazing people that we meet. We are excited for the line cleaning and crowler videos to be used at the many HopCat locations across the country.
