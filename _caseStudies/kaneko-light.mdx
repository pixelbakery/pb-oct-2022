<CaseStudiesIntro title={''}>

We worked with KANEKO to tease their latest and possibly greatest exhibition, Light. They wanted a video that encouraged people to check out the different pieces without giving too much away. By utilizing ambient sound captured from inside the museum itself, we crafted a short but beautiful preview of what there is to explore.

Light has broken single day and overall attendance records and has been featured in prominent publications like the [Omaha World Herald](http://www.omaha.com/) and [Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/). Across Facebook and Instagram, the video has been viewed nearly 13,000 times.
