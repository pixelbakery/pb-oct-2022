<CaseStudiesIntro title={"Bringing Agricultural Innovation to Life"}>
Pattern Ag reached out to us to create a 90-second explainer animation that would showcase their innovative approach to soil analysis and crop planning. The video needed to translate complex scientific concepts into clear, actionable information for farmers and agricultural dealers.

By combining animation with live footage, we created a compelling narrative that demonstrates how Pattern Ag's DNA-based soil analysis helps farmers make better planting decisions with 90% accuracy before the growing season begins.

**Key Message:**
Pattern Ag is transforming agriculture by giving farmers unprecedented insight into their soil's biology, helping them maximize yield potential through data-driven decisions.

**Target Audience:**

Primary: Midwest farmers growing corn and soybeans across North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska.

Secondary: Agricultural dealers and crop advisors who serve as the primary point of contact with farmers.
